  abstract = "The ice arches that usually develop at the northern and southern
              ends of Nares Strait play an important role in modulating the
              export of Arctic Ocean multi-year sea ice. The Arctic Ocean is
              evolving towards an ice pack that is younger, thinner, and more
              mobile and the fate of its multi-year ice is becoming of
              increasing interest. Here, we use sea ice motion retrievals from
              Sentinel-1 imagery to report on the recent behavior of these ice
              arches and the associated ice fluxes. We show that the duration
              of arch formation has decreased over the past 20 years, while the
              ice area and volume fluxes along Nares Strait have both
              increased. These results suggest that a transition is underway
              towards a state where the formation of these arches will become
              atypical with a concomitant increase in the export of multi-year
              ice accelerating the transition towards a younger and thinner
              Arctic ice pack.",
