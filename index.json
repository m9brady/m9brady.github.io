Recently, the sea ice community has entered a new era of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites operating at C-band with the launch of Sentinel-1A in 2014, Sentinel-1B in 2016 and the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) in 2019. These missions represent 5 spaceborne SAR sensors, that together routinely cover the pan-Arctic sea ice domain. Here, we utilized over 60,000 SAR images from Sentinel-1AB (S1) and RCM to generate large-scale sea ice motion (SIM) estimates over the pan-Arctic domain from March to December, 2020. On average, 4.5 million SIM vectors from S1 and RCM were automatically detected per week for 2020 and when combined (S1+RCM) they facilitated the generation of 7-day, 25‚Äâkm SIM products across the pan-Arctic domain. S1+RCM SIM provided more coverage in Hudson Bay, Davis Strait, Beaufort Sea, Bering Sea, and over the North Pole compared to SIM from S1 alone. S1+RCM SIM was able to be resolved within the narrow channels and inlets across the pan-Arctic alleviating the main limitation of coarser resolution sensors. S1+RCM SIM provided larger ice speeds with a mean difference (MD) of 1.3‚Äâkm/day compared to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) SIM product and a MD of 0.76‚Äâkm/day compared to Ocean and Sea Ice-Satellite Application Facility (OSI-SAF) SIM product. S1+RCM was also able to better resolve SIM in the marginal ice zone compared to the NSIDC and OSA-SAF SIM products. Overall, our results demonstrate that combining SIM from multiple spaceborne SAR satellites allows for large-scale SIM to be routinely generated across the pan-Arctic domain.","tags":[],"title":"Large-scale sea ice motion from Sentinel-1 and the RADARSAT Constellation Mission","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Colleen Mortimer","Lawrence Mudryk","Chris Derksen","Mike Brady","Kari Luojus","Pinja Ven√§l√§inen","Mikko Moisander","Juha Lemmetyinen","Matias Takala","Cemal Tanis","Jouni Pulliainen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1647820800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647820800,"objectID":"7d0e4f86ebc90b61d86c27eafdc79a43","permalink":"https://m9brady.github.io/publication/j-rse-2022-112988/","publishdate":"2022-04-22T20:16:49-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/j-rse-2022-112988/","section":"publication","summary":"The European Space Agency (ESA) Snow Climate Change Initiative (CCI+) provides long-term, global time series of daily snow cover fraction and snow water equivalent (SWE). The Snow CCI+ SWE Version 1 (CCIv1) product is built on the GlobSnow algorithm, which combines passive microwave (PMW) data with in situ snow depth (SD) measurements to estimate SWE. While CCIv1 remains algorithmically similar to the most recent GlobSnow product (GlobSnow Version 3), Snow CCI+ SWE Version 2 (CCIv2) incorporates two notable differences. CCIv2 uses updated PMW data from the NASA MEaSUREs Calibrated Passive Microwave Daily EASE-Grid 2.0 Earth Science Data Record and is generated in EASE-Grid 2.0 with 12.5 km grid spacing. It also adjusts SWE retrievals in post-processing by incorporating spatially and temporally varying snow density information. Due to the phased product development framework CCI+ employs, proposed changes between CCIv1 and CCIv2 were implemented in a series of step-wise developmental datasets. Using these developmental datasets, we analyze how changes to input PMW and SD data and the snow density parameterization affect the resulting SWE product. Using in situ snow courses as reference data, we demonstrate that the correlation and RMSE of the CCIv2 developmental product improved 18% (0.10) and 12% (5 mm), respectively, relative to CCIv1. The timing of peak snow mass is shifted two weeks later and a temporal discontinuity in the monthly northern hemisphere snow mass time series associated with the shift from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) to the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) in 2009 is also removed.","tags":[],"title":"Benchmarking algorithm changes to the Snow CCI+ snow water equivalent product","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1642445568,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642445568,"objectID":"446e098a5d9e58bab7d7c209a2d488df","permalink":"https://m9brady.github.io/project/eodms-api-client/","publishdate":"2022-01-17T13:52:48-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/eodms-api-client/","section":"project","summary":"Python client for Natural Resources Canada's Earth Observation Data Management System","tags":[],"title":"EODMS API Client","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"   ‚òùÔ∏è End result of the following code snippets üëá  Checking out a really neat historical sea ice age dataset from NSIDC: https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0611\nfrom io import BytesIO from netrc import netrc from pathlib import Path import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import pandas as pd import requests import xarray as xr from matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap  We need to get the data first (requires a NASA EarthData account!)\nlocal_nc = Path(\u0026#39;./iceage_nsidc.nc\u0026#39;) if local_nc.exists(): ds = xr.open_dataset( local_nc, chunks={\u0026#39;time\u0026#39;: 200, \u0026#39;x\u0026#39;: 722, \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;: 722} # try to have ~100MB chunks ) else: resp = input( \u0026#39;Local dataset does not exist - confirm you \u0026#39; \\ \u0026#39;want to download from NSIDC?

Yet, very little is known about the thickness and dynamics of this ice pack. During winter operations, icebreakers often face besetting events, which can slow or immobilize vessels for up to a few days. Using in situ observations of ice draft and drift collected by moored sonars at two sites in Hudson Strait from 2005 to 2009, we provide the first detailed analysis of sea ice dynamics within Hudson Strait and provide insights into the processes that dictate ice thickness and internal pressure along this unique winter shipping corridor. Prevailing northwesterly winds drive south-southeastward ice motion within the Strait, maintaining polynyas along Baffin Island on the north side of the Strait, and compressing the ice pack against Nunavik on the southern side. As a result, ice on the northern side remains young and thin throughout winter ($\\bar{x}\\_{March} = 1.25 m$), whereas ice on the southern side is older, heavily deformed and ‚àº60% thicker by March ($\\bar{x}\\_{March} = 2.01 m$). Intermittent reversals to southeasterly winds decompress the ice pack on the southern side, increasing the presence of leads and easing navigation through the ice pack to the port in Deception Bay. The spatial variability in sea ice thickness elucidated by the moorings is corroborated at the regional scale using satellite observations from ICESat-2 during winter 2019, 2020, and 2021, and complimented by high-resolution fields of sea ice motion during winter 2021.","tags":[],"title":"Sea Ice Dynamics in Hudson Strait and Its Impact on Winter Shipping Operations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vincent Vionnet","Colleen Mortimer","Mike Brady","Louise Arnal","Ross Brown"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1632441600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632441600,"objectID":"d03d61cecd1f875106b52285c2e0bcd2","permalink":"https://m9brady.github.io/publication/essd-13-4603-2021/","publishdate":"2022-01-16T14:42:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/essd-13-4603-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"In situ measurements of water equivalent of snow cover (SWE) ‚Äì the vertical depth of water that would be obtained if all the snow cover melted completely ‚Äì are used in many applications including water management, flood forecasting, climate monitoring, and evaluation of hydrological and land surface models.

The Arctic Ocean is evolving towards an ice pack that is younger, thinner, and more mobile and the fate of its multi-year ice is becoming of increasing interest. Here, we use sea ice motion retrievals from Sentinel-1 imagery to report on the recent behavior of these ice arches and the associated ice fluxes. We show that the duration of arch formation has decreased over the past 20 years, while the ice area and volume fluxes along Nares Strait have both increased. These results suggest that a transition is underway towards a state where the formation of these arches will become atypical with a concomitant increase in the export of multi-year ice accelerating the transition towards a younger and thinner Arctic ice pack.","tags":[],"title":"Anomalous collapses of Nares Strait ice arches leads to enhanced export of Arctic sea ice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joshua King","Stephen Howell","Mike Brady","Peter Toose","Chris Derksen","Christian Haas","Justin Beckers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1606867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606867200,"objectID":"dfa7cc4c39f4cdeb12d5a5ff16b6e096","permalink":"https://m9brady.github.io/publication/tc-2019-305/","publishdate":"2020-08-08T19:58:38-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tc-2019-305/","section":"publication","summary":"Local-scale variations in snow density and layering on Arctic sea ice were characterized using a combination of traditional snow pit and SnowMicroPen (SMP) measurements. In total, 14 sites were evaluated within the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and Arctic Ocean on both first (FYI) and multi-year (MYI) sea ice. Sites contained multiple snow pits with coincident SMP profiles as well as unidirectional SMP transects. An existing SMP density model was recalibrated using manual density cutter measurements (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ186) to identify best-fit parameters for the observed conditions. Cross-validation of the revised SMP model showed errors comparable to the expected baseline for manual density measurements ($RMSE‚Äâ=‚Äâ34‚Äâkg‚Äâm^{‚àí3}$ or 10.9‚Äâ%) and strong retrieval skill ($R^{2}‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.78$). The density model was then applied to SMP transect measurements to characterize variations at spatial scales of up to 100‚Äâm. A supervised classification trained on snow pit stratigraphy allowed separation of the SMP density estimates by layer-type. The resulting dataset contains 58,882 layer-classified estimates of snow density on sea ice representing 147‚Äâm of vertical variation and equivalent to more than 600 individual snow pits. An average bulk density of $310‚Äâkg‚Äâm^{‚àí3}$ was estimated with clear separation between FYI and MYI environments. Lower densities on MYI ($277‚Äâkg‚Äâm^{‚àí3}$) corresponded with increased depth hoar composition (49.2 %), in strong contrast to composition of the thin FYI snowpack (19.8 %). Spatial auto-correlation analysis showed layered composition on FYI snowpack to persist over long distances while composition on MYI rapidly decorrelated at distances less than 16‚Äâm. Application of the SMP profiles to determine propagation bias in radar altimetry showed the potential errors of 0.5‚Äâcm when climatology is used over known snow density.","tags":[],"title":"Local-scale variability of snow density on Arctic sea ice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lawrence Mudryk","Mar√≠a Santolaria-Ot√≠n","Gerhard Krinner","Martin M√©n√©goz","Chris Derksen","Claire Brutel-Vuilmet","Mike Brady","Richard Essery"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1596153600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596153600,"objectID":"97135d919b6400af544141218fd3c198","permalink":"https://m9brady.github.io/publication/tc-14-2495-2020/","publishdate":"2020-08-08T19:48:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tc-14-2495-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents an analysis of observed and simulated historical snow cover extent and snow mass, along with future snow cover projections from models participating in the World Climate Research Programme Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Where appropriate, the CMIP6 output is compared to CMIP5 results in order to assess progress (or absence thereof) between successive model generations. An ensemble of six observation-based products is used to produce a new time series of historical Northern Hemisphere snow extent anomalies and trends; a subset of four of these products is used for snow mass. Trends in snow extent over 1981‚Äì2018 are negative in all months and exceed $‚àí50√ó10^3‚Äâkm^2‚Äâyr^{‚àí1}$ during November, December, March, and May. Snow mass trends are approximately $‚àí5‚ÄâGt‚Äâyr^{‚àí1}$ or more for all months from December to May. Overall, the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble better represents the snow extent climatology over the 1981‚Äì2014 period for all months, correcting a low bias in CMIP5. Simulated snow extent and snow mass trends over the 1981‚Äì2014 period are stronger in CMIP6 than in CMIP5, although large inter-model spread remains in the simulated trends for both variables. There is a single linear relationship between projected spring snow extent and global surface air temperature (GSAT) changes, which is valid across all CMIP6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. This finding suggests that Northern Hemisphere spring snow extent will decrease by about 8‚Äâ% relative to the 1995‚Äì2014 level per degree Celsius of GSAT increase. The sensitivity of snow to temperature forcing largely explains the absence of any climate change pathway dependency, similar to other fast-response components of the cryosphere such as sea ice and near-surface permafrost extent.","tags":[],"title":"Historical Northern Hemisphere snow cover trends and projected changes in the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Edward Lee Howell","Randall Kenneth Scharien","Jack Landy","Mike Brady"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1593648e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593648e3,"objectID":"6c0db7b408fd3d3b027960b8165bb84d","permalink":"https://m9brady.github.io/publication/tc-2020-171/","publishdate":"2020-08-09T11:26:23-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tc-2020-171/","section":"publication","summary":"Melt ponds form on the surface of Arctic sea ice during spring, influencing how much solar radiation is absorbed into the sea ice-ocean system, which in turn impacts the ablation of sea ice during the melt season. Accordingly, melt pond fraction $(f_p)$ has been shown to be a useful predictor of sea ice area during the summer months. Sea ice dynamic and thermodynamic processes operating within the narrow channels and inlets of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) during the summer months are difficult for model simulations to accurately resolve. Additional information on $f_p$ variability in advance of the melt season within the CAA could help constrain model simulations and/or provide useful information in advance of the shipping season. Here, we use RADARSAT-2 imagery to predict and analyze peak spring $f_p$ and evaluate its utility to provide predictive information with respect to sea ice area during the melt season within the CAA from 2009‚Äì2018. The temporal variability of RADARSAT-2 $f_p$ over the 10-year record was found to be strongly linked to the variability of mean April multi-year ice area and the spatial distribution of RADARSAT-2 $f_p$ was found to be in excellent agreement with the sea ice stage of development prior to the melt season. RADARSAT-2 $f_p$ values were in good agreement with the peak $f_p$ observed from in situ observations but were found to be ‚àº0.05 larger compared to peak MODIS $f_p$ observations. Statistically significant detrended correlations between RADARSAT-2 $f_p$ and summer sea ice area were found for several regions within the CAA.

In recent years, new land cover (LC) datasets at finer spatial resolutions have become available while those currently implemented in most models are outdated. This study assesses the applicability of the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) LC product for use in the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) through comparison with finer resolution datasets over Canada, assisted with reference sample data and a vegetation continuous field tree cover fraction dataset. The results show that in comparison with the finer resolution maps over Canada, the 300 m CCI product provides much improved LC distribution over that from the 1 km GLC2000 dataset currently used to provide initial surface conditions in CLASS. However, the CCI dataset appears to overestimate needleleaf forest cover especially in the taiga-tundra transition zone of northwestern Canada. This may have partly resulted from limited availability of clear sky MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) images used to generate the CCI classification maps due to the long snow cover season in Canada. In addition, changes based on the CCI time series are not always consistent with those from the MODIS or a Landsat-based forest cover change dataset, especially prior to 2003 when only coarse spatial resolution satellite data were available for change detection in the CCI product. It will be helpful for application in global simulations to determine whether these results also apply to other regions with similar landscapes, such as Eurasia. Nevertheless, the detailed LC classes and finer spatial resolution in the CCI dataset provide an improved reference map for use in land surface models in Canada. The results also suggest that uncertainties in the current cross-walking tables are a major source of the often large differences in the plant functional types (PFT) maps, and should be an area of focus in future work.","tags":[],"title":"Comparison and Assessment of Regional and Global Land Cover Datasets for Use in CLASS over Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen E.L.

The daily temporal resolution of passive microwave brightness temperatures provides the most widely utilized observations to detect melt onset but are limited to a spatial resolution of 25‚ÄØkm. Wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery provides a much higher spatial resolution (20‚Äì100‚ÄØm) but melt onset detection remains challenging because of i) insufficient temporal resolution to facilitate accurate melt onset detection, ii) inconsistent viewing geometries and iii) limited image availability across the Arctic. Here, we construct high temporal resolution composite gamma nought backscatter products (1‚ÄØday, 1‚Äì2‚ÄØday and 2‚Äì4‚ÄØday) using Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 over a close-to-seamless revisit region located in northern Canadian Arctic and Greenland for estimating melt onset over Arctic sea ice in 2016 and 2017. We employ the necessary radiometric terrain flattening and local resolution weighting techniques to generate normalised backscatter over the entire study region, removing restrictions limiting analysis to a single sensor or track's swath width by integrating both ascending and descending passes into the composite products. Results indicate that higher temporal resolution multi-sensor composite gamma nought products (1‚ÄØday) that make use of the most imagery provide a robust temporal evolution of the backscatter. This allows for more representative estimates of melt onset as it is easier to separate the melt onset threshold from winter variability that is otherwise a considerable challenge for SAR based melt onset algorithms because of inconsistent temporal resolution. Multi-sensor composite gamma naught melt onset detection is in good agreement with melt onset estimates derived from the Advance Scatterometer (ASCAT) backscatter values and passive microwave brightness temperatures over homogenous sea ice regions but very noticeable improvement was found within narrow channels and regions with more heterogeneous sea ice. In anticipation of the availability of data from even more SAR satellites with the launch of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission, the multi-sensor composite gamma nought approach presented here may offer the most robust approach to estimate the timing of melt onset over sea ice across the Arctic using high spatiotemporal resolution SAR.","tags":[],"title":"Estimating melt onset over Arctic sea ice from time series multi-sensor Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 backscatter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen E.L.

However, there is still uncertainty in SAR derived sea ice motion depending on the ice type and its thermodynamic state. There have been suggestions (mostly theoretical) that use of L-band SAR and its inherent longer wavelength (15‚Äì30cm) and subsequent increased penetration capability could be beneficial for estimating sea ice motion, especially during the melt season. Here, we estimate and analyze sea ice motion for 9 pairs of C- and L-band SAR imagery from RADARSAT-2, PALSAR-1 and PALSAR-2 located in the Canadian Arctic over a variety of sea ice types at different thermodynamic states. Results show that the increased signal penetration of L-band SAR into multi-year ice (MYI) during the melt season facilitates the detection of more motion vectors with stronger cross-correlation coefficients compared to C-band SAR. Over newly formed ice and dry first-year ice, the reduced sensitivity to surface scattering and richer texture from L-band SAR imagery facilitates the detection of more motion vectors with stronger cross-correlation coefficients compared to C-band SAR. Over dry MYI, L-band provided stronger cross-correlation coefficients but C-band detected more motion vectors with a more representative spatial distribution. With Arctic sea ice continuing shift from a multi-year to first-year dominated icescape, coupled with an increasing melt season length, L-band SAR's ability to provide improved sea ice motion estimates during both the melt and freeze-up time periods could prove even more useful in the coming decades.","tags":[],"title":"Comparing L- and C-band synthetic aperture radar estimates of sea ice motion over different ice regimes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris Derksen","Michaela Teich","Mike Brady","Joshua King"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1506384e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506384e3,"objectID":"21e5d9b7dfc8e738b541bea1a4a5b79f","permalink":"https://m9brady.github.io/publication/data-snex17_smp/","publishdate":"2020-08-09T10:59:20-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/data-snex17_smp/","section":"publication","summary":"This data set contains raw penetration force profiles measured at snow pits and along linear transects at Grand Mesa, Colorado using the SnowMicroPen (SMP), a digital snow penetrometer.

In recent years, the Beaufort Sea has experienced considerable ice loss during the summer, which may be indicative of recent changes to this process. In order to investigate this, we quantify the sea ice area flux using RADARSAT from 1997 to 2014 at three gates in Beaufort Sea: the Canadian Basin (entrance), mid-Beaufort (midpoint), and Chukchi (exit). There was a mean annual flux of $42‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ56 √ó 10^3 km^2$ at the Canadian Basin gate, $94‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ92 √ó 10^3 km^2$ at the mid-Beaufort gate and $‚àí83‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ68 √ó 10^3 km^2$ at the Chukchi gate (positive and negative flux signs correspond to ice inflow and outflow, respectively). The majority of ice transport in Beaufort Sea was found to occur from October to May providing replenishment for ice lost during the summer months. The cross-strait gradient in sea level pressure explains ‚àº40% of the variance in the ice area flux at the gates. Remarkably, the mean July‚ÄìOctober net sea ice area flux at the Chukchi gate decreased by ‚àº80% from 2008 to 2014 relative to 1997‚Äì2007 and became virtually ice-free every year since 2008. This reduction was associated with younger (thinner) ice that was unable to survive the summer melt season when either being sequestered from the Canadian Basin and transported through Beaufort Sea during the melt season (2008‚Äì2011) or remaining immobile and present in the vicinity of the Chukchi gate during the melt season (2012‚Äì2014).","tags":[],"title":"Recent changes in sea ice area flux through the Beaufort Sea during the summer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen E.
